Box Model is key concept of CSS.
Every element is treated as a box here. Every Box contains
1. padding
2. border
3. margin

1. padding: the gap between border and actual content is padding
padding: xpx;
x px will given for top,left,right,bottom
padding: tb lr;
padding t  lr  b;
padding: t r b l;

2. border: border is the outmost line of any box
border: width style color;
eg: border:2px solid red;

border-radius will give corner curvature:
border-radius:50% to make circle,
to make any polygon, use clip-path

3. margin: margin is similar to padding but it is outer space for the box.
