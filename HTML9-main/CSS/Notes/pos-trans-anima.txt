Position: it makes an element stay where ever we want.
we have 5 position values
 i.static: By default, all elements have position static, top,left,bottom,right will not have any impact on static

 ii.relative: relative elements compares from its previous position. so top:20px will move element 20px bottom from its previous position

 iii.absolute: absolute elemnts compares from body. so top:20px will move element 20px bottom from body

 iv.fixed: fixed is exactly absolute but scrolling will not have any effect on it

 v.sticky:
 sticky is nothing but relative plus fixed. after a specific query , relative element will become fixed element
