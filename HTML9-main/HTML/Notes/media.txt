HTML allows different kinds of medias
you can play audio by "audio" tag or video by "video" tag
Both tags need controls to make them work and source to give respective video or audio

<audio controls>
    <source src="link to mp3">
</audio>
<video controls>
    <source src="link to mp4">
</video>

you can also give responsive images using picture tag. it means for different devices, we can give different images

<picture>
  <source media="(min-width/max-width:length in px)" srcset="link to image">
  <img src="default image" alt="alt title">
</picture

*** picture tag only uses media and heirarchy should be top to down

you can also embed a map, img,video,audio,pdfs,docs, anything using iframe

<iframe src=""></iframe>

** for maps--> google maps
** for videos --> youtube
** for animations --> lottiefiles
